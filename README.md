## My process

I worked on the mobile design first. I used flexbox for the layouts. For desktop design, I used grid. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I was able to add an advanced box shadow using this:
```css
.main-card section {
    box-shadow: 0 8px 8px -4px #a3a5ae;
}
```

### Continued development

I am still not satisfied with the grid layout on desktop design. I would like to keep working on it to create better transitions.
